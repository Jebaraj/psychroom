Herrick Laboratory psychrometric chamber test data format.

Background
----------

A need arose for standardizing the experimental data format at Ray W. Herrick
Laboratories due to painstaking I/O methods, inconsistent/ambiguous unit
handling, and nonexistent centralized storage.  This project aims to fix these
problems and more.
