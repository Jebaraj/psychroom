# Measurement Data Output Standard

This is the Herrick Laboratory psychrometric chamber experimental data standard.
The guidelines described here should be followed to the best of the
experimenter's ability when testing HVAC equipment in the psychrometric
chambers.

## Standard Measurement Labeling Convention

The goal of the measurement label is to describe the phsyical quantities
recorded during the experiment. The aim of the label is to record
_meta-information_ about the measurement. In other words, storing the:

* who,
* what,
* where,
* and how

of the measurement.  This is accomplished using a standard labeling convention
by the standards committee.  The standard labeling convention is described
below and its parts are described in individual sections henceforth.

    {COMPONENT}{#?}_{FLUID}{#?}_{LOCATION}{#?}_{TYPE}

The label stores information about the component, fluid, location, and type of
measurement being recorded.  Additionally, an optional numeric identifier can be
assigned to distiguish between multiple occurances of components or locations.
For example in a dual compressor systems, the compressors could be identified as
compressor 0 and compressor 1.

### Differential Measurements

Differential measurements are handled in a similar way to normal single point measurements.

However, each part of the namestring can now be composed of two parts - the distinction between 
first and second part is made by using a capital letter. Before the type, add "Delta" to specify
that a difference measurement is used. Naming scheme:

    {component1}{Componen2?}{#?}_{fluid1}{Fluid2?}{#?}_{location1}{Location2}{#?}_Delta{type1}{Type2?}

#### Examples:
Difference between compressor refrigerant inlet temperature and indoor heat exchanger (evaporator) refrigerant 
outlet temperature:

    idhxComp_ref_outIn_DeltaT
 
 Difference between air inlet temperature of evaporator and refrigerant inlet temperature:
    
    idhx_airRef_inIn_DeltaT

### Component Label Identifier

The component label identifier is used to describe which component in the
overall system the measurement is taken.  A list of acceptable component

### Example Systems

Here is a list of systems with their sensors labeled as examples.

#### Refrigerant circuit of a ductless split heat pump system

Ductless split heat pump system is a split system which can provide heating or cooling to a building zone. It operates with a compressor, a reversing valve, an indoor heat exchanger, an electronic expansion valve, an outdoor heat exchanger and an accumulator. The indoor heat exchanger is housed inside the indoor unit while the other components are housed in the outdoor unit. The reversing valve controls the refrigerant flow to provide either heating or cooling to the building zone.

In this example, an experiment was designed to measure the states of refrigerant between components and the refrigerant mass flow rate of the system. The schematic of the sensor location is given as follows.

<img src="https://raw.github.com/ahjortland/psychroom/master/docs/DHP.png" alt="DHP_ref_fig" title="DHP_ref_fig" style="width: 500px;"/>

In the schematic, the indoor unit is named as ahu1 and the outdoor unit is named as ahu2. M stands for refrigerant mass flowmeter, T stands for immersion thermocouples, P stands for gage pressure transducers and W stands for a power transducer. The heat exchangers in the system are not labeled as condenser and evaporator because both heat exchangers can serve as a condenser or an evaporator. The power transducers are positioned next to the indoor unit and outdoor unit labels as they are measuring power consumption of the indoor units and outdoor units but not the power consumption of the individual components. The refrigerant on the right-handed side of the heat exchangers are always in vapor form and the pipes on that side are the gas line while other pipes are called the liquid line. The location of liquid line and gas line and the refrigerant flow direction are indicated in the legend in the diagram.

The labeling of the sensors is listed as follows.
