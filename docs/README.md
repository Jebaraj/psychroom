# Measurement Data Output Standard

This is the Herrick Laboratory psychrometric chamber experimental data standard.
The guidelines described here should be followed to the best of the
experimenter's ability when testing HVAC equipment in the psychrometric
chambers.

## Standard Measurement Labeling Convention

The goal of the measurement label is to describe the phsyical quantities
recorded during the experiment. The aim of the label is to record
_meta-information_ about the measurement. In other words, storing the:

* who,
* what,
* where,
* and how

of the measurement.  This is accomplished using a standard labeling convention
by the standards committee.  The standard labeling convention is described
below and its parts are described in individual sections henceforth.

    {COMPONENT}{#?}_{FLUID}{#?}_{LOCATION}{#?}_{TYPE}

The label stores information about the component, fluid, location, and type of
measurement being recorded.  Additionally, an optional numeric identifier can be
assigned to distiguish between multiple occurances of components or locations.
For example in a dual compressor systems, the compressors could be identified as
compressor 0 and compressor 1.

### Component Label Identifier

The component label identifier is used to describe which component in the
overall system the measurement is taken.  A list of acceptable component
identifiers is shown below.

### Differential Measurements

Differential measurements are handled in a similar way to normal single point measurements.

However, each part of the namestring can now be composed of two parts - the distinction between 
first and second part is made by using a capital letter. Before the type, add "Delta" to specify
that a difference measurement is used. Naming scheme:

    {component1}{Componen2?}{#?}_{fluid1}{Fluid2?}{#?}_{location1}{Location2}{#?}_Delta{type1}{Type2?}

#### Examples:
Difference between compressor refrigerant inlet temperature and indoor heat exchanger (evaporator) refrigerant 
outlet temperature:

    idhxComp_ref_outIn_DeltaT
 
 Difference between air inlet temperature of evaporator and refrigerant inlet temperature:
    
    idhx_airRef_inIn_DeltaT
